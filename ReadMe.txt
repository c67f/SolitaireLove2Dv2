Postmortem: The main thing I would have done differently was focus less on certain features, like getting auto-cascading piles and snapping to piles on dropping a card working, and more time on the basic requirements. Towards the initial deadline I ended up with those features 80% working but buggy by but more basic functionality like having 7 piles of increasing numbers of cards or drawing from a card deck not implemented. I needed to use the late policy to finish. I also just needed to read the requirements of the assignment and review what solitaire looks like and how it's played - I was just going off my memory and knowledge from when the assignment was initially covered and didn't think to check those again till close to the initial deadline.
