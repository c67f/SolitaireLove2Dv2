Criteria from Ronan and Tyler - I tried to address some of their feedback by eliminating all my print statements and old commented out code (mentioned by both), and adding some comments to break up the card:draw code and make it clearer, something Tyler mentioned specifically



Postmortem: The main issues with my previous version was cluttered code. Some of that was from lots of print statements scattered throughout that I was using for testing, as well as old commented-out code, and that was easily fixed, but there's also some disorganization, with things like lots of functions in main or redundant functionality, and while I addressed that disorganization slightly I ended up running out of time to do so while working on getting the additional functionality (reshuffling the deck and adding pile logic) working and fixing bugs.
